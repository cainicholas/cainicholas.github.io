                                REFLECTION
     Ideally the project we submitted isn't really finished but does do for the most part things which would make the game playable.
The beginning of our pair project all starts with two bubbles and building from there. The point of our game is basically to have
two bubbles on the opposite side to shoot at each other and basically destroy one another. "I" being specific since for the most part
I did the work created two bubbles and started to watch Daniel Shiffman on how he made space invaders to make it move and shoot. Since we
are working together again I am literally going to make him do most of the work since for the most part he sat there staring at my screen
even though I told him things to do. A issue I was having was moving the two bubbles up and down as the Daniel Shiffman video was a bit misleading.
The issue I was having was that it was accepting the value but not pushing it through to make it move. To solve, I was surprised that there were
other ascii for these buttons to move up and down so I went on a specific website which tells p5 ascii and found the values for them. The other issue
where I had to rethink, things is to make something shoot, the coordinates to make them shoot came out at extremely high values. With some help, I changed
some coding from a function to a class which works better and fixed the coding. The hardest part of the coding was of course the shooting code. Initially I
made a function for this which apparently isn't the right way to go. Changing it to a class with the help of others I, using the keypress function made it
so that when I pressed a button, through drops.push(drop) which pushes and creates the bubbles out like bullets made to move. It is moved through the class
which has a move function adding coordinates to a defined x coordinate of a bubble. Then I made it so it will appear and move through the draw function and
its done.
